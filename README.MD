# Security strategy

In today’s increasingly interconnected world, securing information systems and data is a critical priority for all organizations. In this regard, it’s crucial to determine the targets, assess the level of protection they require and understand the repercussions in case of a security breach.<br>
The repercussions of security flaws can be particularly frustrating for those involved including:
- The user: Potential target of identity or information theft which can result in a significant loss of trust in the application.
- The application owner: A security breach could cause service interruption and compliance violation leading to legal penalties and financial loss.
- The application developer: Should there be flaws in security, it could impact the organization’s reputation, result in potential lawsuits, and lead to financial losses associated with remediation effort.<br>

This security strategy seeks to establish a comprehensive framework outlining the necessary steps to implement robust protections against the risks we encounter. In this document, we will address each layer involved, identify potential risks, and outline appropriate countermeasures.<br>
The security strategy encompasses several critical layers, such as:
Transversal security rules and good practices
- Frontend vulnerabilities
- Api vulnerabilities
- Database injections and malware threats

This strategy was designed with a keen focus on optimizing the balance between ergonomics and safety
